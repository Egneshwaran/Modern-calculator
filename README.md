## Development

This project uses React for the UI components and state management. Key technical features include:
- React Hooks for state management
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Event handling for button interactions
- Secure calculation handling

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
